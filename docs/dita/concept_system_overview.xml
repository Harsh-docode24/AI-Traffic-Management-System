  <title>Dual-Model Traffic Control Framework Overview</title>
  <body>
    The system integrates two deep learning models:
    one for real-time vehicle detection and one for
    emergency vehicle identification.

    Outputs from both models are processed by a deterministic
    rule engine to dynamically control traffic signals.
