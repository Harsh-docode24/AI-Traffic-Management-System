# Development Steps

This folder contains the scripts from each stage of the project's development, showing the progression from a simple image detector to the final integrated system.

- **`detect_on_image.py`**: Initial proof-of-concept for detecting vehicles on a single image.
- **`process_video.py`**: Extended the logic to process a full video file.
- **`count_vehicles.py`**: Added object tracking and vehicle counting logic.
...and so on.
